# Github REST API Demo:

* [Live Demo](http://etgrieco.github.io/github-rest-api)

# Description:

This demo takes in a username, and returns the Github repositories associated with that username using the [List User Repositories API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#list-user-repositories). This is a single-page web application using React and JQuery libraries. Because this is a relatively simple demo, libraries are loaded inline in a single HTML file.
